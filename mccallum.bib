  Title                    = {Realtime Estimation of Illumination Direction for Augmented Reality on Mobile Devices},
  Abstract                 = {Augmented reality simulations aims to provide realistic blending between real world and virtual objects. One of the important factors for realistic augmented reality is correct illumination simulation. Mobile augmented reality systems is one of the best options for introducing augmented reality to the mass market due to its low production cost and ubiquitousness. In mobile augmented reality systems, the ability to correctly simulate in realtime the illumination direction that matches the illumination direction of the real world is limited. Developing a mobile augmented reality systems with the ability to estimate illumination direction presents a challenge due to low computation power and dynamically changing environment. In this paper, we described a new method that we have developed for realtime illumination direction estimation for mobile augmented reality systems, using analysis of shadow produced by a reference object that doubles as a 3D augmented reality marker. The implementation of the method could estimate the direction of a single strong light source in a controlled environment with a very good degree of accuracy, with angular error averaging lower than 0.038 radians. The current implementation achieved 2.1 FPS performance in a low-end Android mobile device, produced proper estimation within 15 seconds using a uniform surface, and demonstrated scalability potential.},

Cognitive screening and training are two important preventative treatments, which can lead to early detection of cognitive decline. In this work, the &#8220;Cognitive Augmented Reality Cubes&#8221; (CogARC) system is presented, i.e. a serious game for cognitive training and screening, utilising an interaction technique based on Augmented Reality and the manipulation of tangible, physical objects (cubes). The game is a collection of cognitive mini-games of preventative nature and is, primarily, targeting elderly players (&#8805;60 years old). A preliminary testing was conducted focusing on the game experience that CogARC offers (utilising the In-Game Experience Questionnaire), the usability of the system (using the System Usability Scale), and the specific user observations and remarks, as documented by open, semi-structured interviews. Overall, CogARC demonstrated satisfying positive responses, however, the negative reactions indicated that there are specific problems with aspects of the interaction technique and a number of mini-games. The open interview shed more light on the specific issues of each mini-game and further interpretation of user interactions. The current study managed to provide interesting insights into the game design elements, integration of Augmented Reality, tangible interaction of the system, and on how elderly players perceive and use those interaction components.},

  Abstract                 = {Using serious games for cognitive screening can provide a motivating and entertaining alternative to traditional cognitive screening methods. Cognitive decline is usually measured by tests of mental processing, however age-related changes in sleep may also reveal signs of cognitive decline among older individuals. The current work presents and evaluates a gaming system for cognitive screening and sleep duration assessment of the elderly. The gaming system consists of an original serious game for cognitive screening (Smartkuber) and a smartwatch (Basis Peak). A pilot study is conducted to identify and improve the weaknesses of the gaming system and to evaluate the gaming system as to its usability and the game experience it offers for elderly players, assesing its suitability for a large-scale study. The pilot study lasted for 6 weeks and 101 gaming sessions were recorded from 5 elderly players. Elderly players were entertained by the game, while they were impressed by the smartwatch&#8217;s performance. Limitations of the study and future directions are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: The goal of this study was to design and develop a serious game for cognitive health screening of the elderly, namely Smartkuber, and evaluate its construct, criteria (concurrent and predictive), and content validity, assessing its relationship with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate the elderly players&#8217; game experience with Smartkuber. Subjects and Methods: Thirteen older adults were enrolled in the study. The game was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team. The study follows a mixed methodological approach, utilizing the In-Game Experience Questionnaire to assess the players&#8217; game experience and a correlational study, to examine the relationship between the Smartkuber and MoCA scores. The learning effect is also examined by comparing the mean game scores of the first and last game sessions of each player (Delta scores). Results: All 13 participants (mean age: 68.69, SD: 7.24) successfully completed the study. Smartkuber demonstrated high concurrent validity with the MoCA test (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.81, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.001) and satisfying levels of predictive and content validity. The Delta scores showed no statistically significant differences in scoring, thus indicating no learning effects during the Smartkuber game sessions. Conclusions: The study shows that Smartkuber is a promising tool for cognitive health screening, providing an entertaining and motivating gaming experience to elderly players. Limitations of the study and future directions are discussed.},

  Title                    = {Augmented Reality Serious Gaming for Cognitive Health},
  Abstract                 = {Cognitive impairment in the elderly can be associated with the normal ageing processes or be a symptom of early onset dementia. Even though, early detection of dementia has many benefits, cognitive impairment is still underrecognised and under-diagnosed. This lack of diagnosis often leads to confusion over behavioural changes and prevents social and medical intervention and planning. Cognitive screening represents the initial step in a process of further assessment for cognitive impairment, leading to early diagnosis; however, it presents certain intrinsic limitations. These include culture, gender, and educational biases, long test-retest periods, &#8220;white coat&#8221; and learning effects, limited test validation and the user&#8217;s potential lack of motivation. Serious games can address those limitations and be an alternative to traditional, pen-and-paper and computerised cognitive screening tests, potentially motivating and engaging the user to regularly perform cognitive screening tasks, thus increasing the potential to recognise cognitive impairment and trigger referral for a more comprehensive, formal assessment. The current work contributes by designing, implementing, and testing a novel, gaming approach for the cognitive screening process, utilising stimulating cognitive training. The study thoroughly describes all the design and development stages of a serious game for cognitive training and screening from its inception and its theoretical groundings to its Release Candidate version and the evaluation of its test validity, focusing on the iterative design process and the evaluation of each stage. Finally, a cognitive training game for cognitive health screening of the elderly is produced, utilising an interaction technique based on Augmented Reality (AR) and the manipulation of tangible, physical objects (cubes). The game succeeds in stimulating the cognitive function of the elderly players, presenting high concurrent validity versus the widely used Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Directions for future research in the area include the use of wearable biosensors - such as smartwatches - for cognitive health screening purposes, suggesting an ecosystem with serious games in the centre. The term &#8220;cognitive passport&#8221; is defined and discussed, as a tool for tracking personal cognitive health.},

  Abstract                 = {A large number of dementia patients receive home-based care, in order to maintain their independence and improve quality of life and health status. The current formal home-based care model presents certain limitations related to the monitoring of the patients and the re- porting of the progression of physical and cognitive decline. In recent years, novel care models and assistive technologies have been proposed in order to improve the quality of care and assistance services. In this paper, we test the assumption that the use of smartwatches for monitoring physical health aspects of dementia patients can benefit formal home-based care, by providing formal caregivers with additional, important information about significant, health-related events that may have happened during the non-visit home care hours. We perform a qualitative feasibility study - consisted of a small-scale usability study with one dementia patient, and an expert (physician) review - in order to test and evaluate the efficacy of a smartwatch intervention in home-based dementia care, as well as to examine its potential for a subsequent, larger-scale study. The smartwatch documented participant&#8217;s health-related issues regarding night sleep disturbances, potentially frequent toilet visits, day- time snoozing, low sleep quality and early waking up times. Those issues were verified by the project&#8217;s physician and, subsequently, measures can be taken to ensure the patient&#8217;s good health, safety, and quality of life.},

Social networking and casual gaming have broadened the market for, and acceptance of, games. This has coincided with a realization of their power to engage and motivate players. Good computer games are excellent examples of modern educational theory [1]. The military, health providers, governments, and educators, all use computer games. This paper focuses on Games for Health, discussing the range of areas and approaches to developing these games. We extend a taxonomy for Games for Health, describe a case study on games for dementia sufferers, and finally, present some challenges and research opportunities in this area.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer science students come from the gamer generation. A generation accustomed to receiving instant feedback and constant reward for action. This expectation creates tension between traditional assessment models and the learning style of the gamers taking our courses. In this paper we discuss how game design principles can be used as part of modern instructional design. We then present two case studies at different levels of course design, from the design of exam assessment to the learning outcomes for a whole degree. The first case study comes from a first year game design course where a confidence based multi-choice system was designed using game balance mechanics. We show that by using a game design approach we can create well balanced confidence intervals. The second case study focuses on the use of experience points (XP) and character sheets to track student development and present learning objectives in a form familiar to our students. This can also be used to motivate extra curricular activity and organise group activities.

  Abstract                 = {Most artificial neural networks suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where previously learnt information is suddenly and completely lost when new information is learnt. Memory in real neural systems does not appear to suffer from this unusual behaviour. In this thesis we discuss the problem of catastrophic forgetting in Hop&#64257;eld networks, and investigate various potential solutions. We extend the pseudorehearsal solution of Robins (1995) enabling it to work in this attractor network, and compare the results with the unlearning procedure proposed by Crick and Mitchison (1983). We then explore a familiarity measure based on the energy pro&#64257;le of the learnt patterns. By using the ratio of high energy to low energy parts of the network we can robustly distinguish the learnt patterns from the large number of spurious &#8220;fantasy&#8221; patterns that are common in these networks. This energy ratio measure is then used to improve the pseudorehearsal solution so that it can store 0.3N patterns in the Hop&#64257;eld network, significantly more than previous proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore links between the mechanisms investigated in this thesis and the consolidation of newly learnt material during sleep.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of ICT in the Norwegian education system is encouraged, and is believed to have positive effects on the pupils learning outcome. However the use is often limited to writing and reading, and the potential of ICT systems in education is not taken advantage. This thesis looks at implementing an alternative interaction paradigm to the widely used mouse and keyboard approach. Augmented reality is used for providing a tangible user interface for the pupils. The justification for the positive aspects of introducing this tangible approach is grounded in developmental and educational theory, as well as previous work using tangible user interfaces and augmented reality in an educational context. Collaborative aspects, and how AR can encourage it, has been one of the main focuses throughout the thesis. Contact was made with a primary school, more specific a 6th grade class. An AR application was developed, based on theoretical background. An early test using a simple AR application was conducted, however the further developed and more advanced application was not user tested due development taking more time than estimated. Based on reviewed related work and the results from the initial user test, there are indications that AR can offer positive aspects in an educational context.},

  Abstract                 = {Serious games for dementia (SG4D) hold their own, unique and significant space within the Games for Health domain. However, the SG4D field still has not been fully mapped out and classified. In this work, we present a generic taxonomy of serious games for dementia, based on the health functions and the health purposes they serve. Firstly, we classify dementia games based on the health function they serve, in: cognitive, physical and social-emotional games. Each of these functions serves a variety of health purposes, leading us to a second, lower level of classification in: preventative, rehabilitative, assessing and educative games. Furthermore, we provide an ex-post evaluation of the proposed taxonomy by exploring whether the existing serious games for dementia can be validly classified, based on the proposed taxonomic characters. To this end, we collect and analyse a set of dementia-related serious games (e.g. WiiSports, Big Brain Academy, Cognifit, MinWii, et al.) by performing a literature review. The results show that the taxonomical system covers a sub-field of &#8220;games for health&#8221; and indicates areas which are under-explored by current games.},

The recent popularization of novel interaction methods of consoles, such as the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, has provided an opportunity for the elderly to engage in computer and video games.

To address these challenges, we propose an architecture consisted of Augmented Reality (as an output mechanism) combined with gestured-based devices (as an input method). The intention of this work is to provide a theoretical justification for using these technologies and to integrate them into an architecture, acting as a basis for potentially creating suitable interaction techniques for the elderly players.},

  Abstract                 = {Serious games find wide application in the health domain, occupying their own place in the video game industry (games for health). Currently, there is a proliferation of cognitive training, exercise and social games, targeting one of the most dangerous disease of the era: dementia, as well as its various symptoms and stages like Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). However, the dementia-related gaming field is still uncharted. In this literature review, we list studies on serious games related to dementia, that are supported by evaluation tests on dementia, MCI and AD patients with published, peer-reviewed results. This review discusses the effects that games, which include Wii Fit, Wii Sports, Big Brain Academy, Lumosity, SmartBrain Games, MasterQuiz, MINDs et al., have on dementia-related conditions. The review leads us to the conclusions that, firstly, even though many games were developed for entertainment purposes, they are being used for health reasons (usually after technical or conceptual modification), acquiring the characteristics of serious games and, secondly, dementia games do have an effect on cognitive impaired people. If that effect is longlasting and/or transferable to the daily activities is a matter of further scientific investigation.},

However, with the increasing size of game development teams, and the increasing demands on smaller game titles, the use of middleware and other third-party tools are becoming increasingly important to the industry. While there are still game developers who are reluctant to employ code not developed in-house, this position is getting harder to justify with the changes in the marketplace and development strategies. An example of this can be seen with the widespread use of game engines from third parties, e.g. the Unreal Engine and Unity 3D.},

This `mirror' is augmented by virtual balls that bounce realistically when hit by the audience. The effect is created with a computer and a single camera. It is robust and convincing and we have devised several different games that an audience can play. Since 2005, we have displayed these games publicly at two international science fairs, and to many student groups. We usually explain the rules of the games briefly, but even this is hardly necessary. People learned to manipulate the virtual objects intuitively and could infer the rules of scoring in only a few minutes. Our games encourage cooperation and provide an enjoyable, active group experience without making individuals self conscious.},

  Abstract                 = {Hopfield/constraint satisfaction type networks can be used to learn (autoassociate) patterns. Random inputs to the network will sometimes converge on states which are learned patterns, and sometimes converge on states which are unlearned/spurious. It would be useful for many reasons to be able to tell whether or not a given state was learned or spurious. In this paper we present a robust and general method, based on 'energy profiles', which allows us to make this distinction. We briefly describe related research, and note links with the study of recall, recognition and familiarity in the psychological literature.},

With the emergence of the computer gaming industry, with its continuous improvement in technology and fidelity, there is a potential for synergy. Simulations and games developed specifically for the military are generally costly as the full development cost must be covered. These are also expensive to update to match current technology. In this project at the Norwegian Army Military Academy we have used a commercial game specifically designed to have the potential to be used by the military. The learning objective for the course was to understand squad level tactics. Our results show that even if the cadets, particularly the gamers, enjoy playing the game and believe that it supports their learning process, it does not have any significant positive or negative effect on learning. In this paper we present research that explains similar results and discusses potential reasons for a lack of clear change in the overall performance. We conclude by proposing a new study to assess the longer term effects of game based education at NAMA.},
